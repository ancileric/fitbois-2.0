/**
 * The FitBros 3.0 rules, as the group agreed them.
 *
 * Lifted from the shared rulebook circulated before Week 0, so the app and the
 * document cannot drift into saying different things. If a rule changes, it
 * changes in both places together.
 *
 * `ties` records which other rules a rule leans on — the fine is only legible
 * next to the logging rule, and the app should let people follow that.
