 * there is no stored state to drift.
 *
 * Replaces consistencyCalculator.ts, which models the FitBois 2.0 rules
 * (a workload ladder scored on points). Both exist until the screens migrate.
 *
 * Plain CommonJS on purpose: the Express server requires this same file, so the
 * rules can never drift between what the app shows and what the API charges.
 * Types are in seasonEngine.d.ts.
