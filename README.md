# FitBois 2.0 - Challenge Tracker 💪

A full-stack fitness challenge tracking application built for the FitBois 2.0 6-month fitness challenge.

## Challenge Overview

**Focus:** Consistency and personal progress - not who's already the fittest, but who actually shows up and improves.

**Timeline:** January 19 - July 31, 2026 (~6 months)  
**Buy-in:** ₹5,000 per person

### Key Rules

#### Consistency System
- Everyone starts with **5 update days/week**
- 3 clean weeks → move to **4 days/week**
- Another 3 clean weeks → **3 days/week**
- Miss a week → move back up one level
- Miss 2 weeks at 5 days/week → **eliminated**
- Steps allowed once per week, only at 5-day level

#### Goals & Categories
- **5 goals at a time**, one from each category:
  1. 🏃‍♂️ Cardio / Endurance
  2. 💪 Strength
  3. 📅 Consistency / Habit Building
  4. ⚽ Sports / Play
  5. 🎯 Personal Growth (new sport/skill)
- **At least one must be difficult** (a real stretch)
- Complete all 5 → lock in next set of 5

#### Scoring & Winning
- Every completed goal = **1 point**
- Every clean week = **1 point**
- Same goal can't be reused unless clearly progressed
- **Most points wins**
- Tiebreakers: more categories → better consistency → group vote

#### Proof Requirements
- **Minimum 3 proofs/week**
- Time-stamped photos, videos, or app screenshots only
